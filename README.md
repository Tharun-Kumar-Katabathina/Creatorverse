# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Notes

Building the Creatorverse app was a great learning experience. One of the challenges was ensuring smooth
integration with Supabase, especially handling asynchronous operations and state management in React.
Styling the app with PicoCSS was straightforward, and the framework's simplicity helped maintain a clean
and consistent design.
