# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Notes

integration with Supabase, especially handling asynchronous operations and state management in React.
Styling the app with PicoCSS was straightforward, and the framework's simplicity helped maintain a clean
and consistent design.
